# FARMERS-MARKET-DASHBOARD-POWERBI-

Project Overview :

The Farmers Market Dashboard is an interactive Power BI solution designed to analyze sales, customer behavior, and seasonal demand trends. It provides farmers, vendors, and decision-makers with data-driven insights to optimize inventory, pricing, and operations.

Key Features

Sales Analysis: Track total sales, revenue trends, and growth patterns.

Customer Insights: Identify top-selling products and seasonal preferences.

Category Breakdown: Visualize performance of product categories.

Time-Based Trends: Compare monthly, seasonal, and yearly sales.

Interactive Filters: Drill down into specific vendors, time periods, or products.


Project Workflow :

1. Data Collection

Collected raw sales and transaction datasets from farmers market sources.

Data stored in CSV/Excel format before integration into Power BI.

2. Data Transformation

Cleaned raw data using Power Query (removed duplicates, formatted dates, normalized categories).

Built a star schema data model (fact tables for sales, dimension tables for products/customers).

Created calculated columns and measures with DAX (e.g., YoY growth, revenue per category).

3. Dashboard Development

Designed interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs, slicers, and visuals.

Added drill-through and filters for in-depth analysis.

Included trend analysis visuals (line charts, bar charts, pie charts, KPIs).

4. Insight Generation

Identified peak sales periods (seasonal trends).

Discovered best-performing product categories.

Provided actionable recommendations for better inventory & pricing strategies.

Tools & Skills Used

Insights & Impact :

Seasonal products (e.g., fruits, vegetables) peak in specific months.
